# Quiz_Maker
 Final project made for the Udemy's Course Python 3 COMPLETO: Do iniciante ao avan√ßado. It consists of a quiz maker for students, which takes standardized quiz files to generate a new one with one random question from each quiz file. During the development of this project, I learned about file manipulation in Python 3.
